                                        Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of 
                    the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States of America. 
                    Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become 
                    the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and 
                    professional contexts such as science, navigation and law. English is the most spoken language 
                    in the world and the third-most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese 
                    and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language 
                    or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states. There are more people who have 
                    learned English as a second language than there are native speakers. As of 2005, it was 
                    estimated that there were over 2 billion speakers of English. English is the majority 
                    native language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and 
                    the Republic of Ireland, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, 
                    South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. It is a co-official language of the United Nations, 
                    the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is 
                    the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this 
                    Indo-European branch.</p>
